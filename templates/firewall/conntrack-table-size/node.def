#
# Config template for: firewall conntrack-table-size
# 
# Sets the size of the TCP connection tracking table in the netfilter
# nf_conntrack module, which is used by firewall and NAT.  The size of
# this table determines how many TCP connections can be simultaneously
# tracked.  If new connections arrive and the table is full, older
# connections will be dropped out of the table.  System administrators
# must set the connection tracking table size based on the number of
# connections they expect their system to track.  The connection
# tracking table consumes kernel memory, so the size selected should
# be no larger than necessary.
#
# default value when firewall is not set - 16384
# default value when firewall is set - 32768
